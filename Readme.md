EXISTING SYSTEM

The current method of booking tours through agents is in place. However, there may be room for improvement in terms of efficiency and convenience. One potential solution could be to implement an online booking system that allows customers to book tours directly without the need for an intermediary agent. This would streamline the process and potentially reduce costs for both the customer and the tour company. Additionally, it would provide customers with more control over their booking experience and allow for greater flexibility in terms of scheduling and customization.

Another option could be to improve the existing system of tour booking by agents. This could involve providing agents with better training and resources to ensure that they are able to provide customers with accurate and up-to-date information about available tours. Additionally, the tour company could work to improve communication and collaboration with agents to ensure that the booking process is as smooth and efficient as possible. By making these improvements, the tour company could potentially increase customer satisfaction and loyalty, as well as improve overall efficiency and profitability.

Limitations:

 When booking tours through agents,
 there are certain limitations that should be considered.
 One of the main limitations is the lack of flexibility in terms of customization.
